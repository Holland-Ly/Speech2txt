[00:00:00,917]  my three words concept from chris broger.
[00:00:05,259]  now there's three words every single year.
[00:00:08,246]  i choose to work on. so actually it's three areas. i choose to work on. i learned this from one of my virtual mentor, named chris broke.
[00:00:18,854]  and he actually developed it.
[00:00:21,159]  i think that's like 20 years ago.
[00:00:23,657]  i only discovered his way a few years back, but i truly, truly liked it.
[00:00:30,184]  because before, my three words, i'm using a special goal each year to have a special area i need to work.
[00:00:39,279]  i said, a person.
[00:00:40,894]  one year i worked on a slow to judge, quick to love when i meet different people.
[00:00:47,395]  and then another year i'm working on maybe lessons.
[00:00:51,030]  more. another year i'm working on to learn the new technology more.
[00:00:58,088]  another year i learned what was set up the the goal for myself is to how i can learn from the young people they're 20 years younger than me
[00:01:08,747]  but since i read the book of bruce groot and
[00:01:13,384]  is broken.
[00:01:14,738]  and also read his blogs and regarding this my three words each year.
[00:01:21,592]  and i really, really like this idea.
[00:01:23,746]  2024ers minds learn work.
[00:01:26,868]  is aware.
[00:01:28,865]  here.
[00:01:31,463]  so if you wanted to know the meanings of that and how to apply it, actually wrote a blog link.
[00:01:39,194]  probably can find that one.
[00:01:41,391]  just remember.
