00:00:00,917 --> 00:00:03,588
 my three words concept from chris broger.

2
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:07,650
 now there's three words every single year.

3
00:00:08,246 --> 00:00:18,228
 i choose to work on. so actually it's three areas. i choose to work on. i learned this from one of my virtual mentor, named chris broke.

4
00:00:18,854 --> 00:00:20,503
 and he actually developed it.

5
00:00:21,159 --> 00:00:22,522
 i think that's like 20 years ago.

6
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:29,293
 i only discovered his way a few years back, but i truly, truly liked it.

7
00:00:30,184 --> 00:00:38,452
 because before, my three words, i'm using a special goal each year to have a special area i need to work.

8
00:00:39,279 --> 00:00:40,199
 i said, a person.

9
00:00:40,894 --> 00:00:46,829
 one year i worked on a slow to judge, quick to love when i meet different people.

10
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:50,515
 and then another year i'm working on maybe lessons.

11
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,534
 more. another year i'm working on to learn the new technology more.

12
00:00:58,088 --> 00:01:07,252
 another year i learned what was set up the the goal for myself is to how i can learn from the young people they're 20 years younger than me

13
00:01:08,747 --> 00:01:12,869
 but since i read the book of bruce groot and

14
00:01:13,384 --> 00:01:14,213
 is broken.

15
00:01:14,738 --> 00:01:20,700
 and also read his blogs and regarding this my three words each year.

16
00:01:21,592 --> 00:01:23,162
 and i really, really like this idea.

17
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:26,106
 2024ers minds learn work.

18
00:01:26,868 --> 00:01:27,739
 is aware.

19
00:01:28,865 --> 00:01:29,263
 here.

20
00:01:31,463 --> 00:01:38,537
 so if you wanted to know the meanings of that and how to apply it, actually wrote a blog link.

21
00:01:39,194 --> 00:01:40,287
 probably can find that one.

22
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:42,013
 just remember.
